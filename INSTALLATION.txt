Installation Guide

tar -xvf expressEditInstall.tar.gz   decompress files/folders

Relocate files/folders within the resulting expressEditInstall directory as follows:

There are two ways to run this system:
1. Using one set of class files to run multiple websites (with one set of class files placed in includes folder directly in the Server Home directory ie one level above public_html)
2. Or using one set of class files for each website merged into the includes folder  which holds otherwise holds the local class files for each website (ie. site configs and local class files if site method customization is used) within public_html or sub-directory if used.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single Site Method: Uses  the class files directly in the public html/includes folder or subdirectory: 
merge/rename main_class_files to the includes folder already within the expressEditInstall directory which contains a few other 'local' files.
Then move the includes dir:
Relocation Sample:
/home/youracc/public_html/includes  or  /var/www/includes (containing merged main class files and the Cfg.class.php and also a site_master, navigate_loc,gallery_loc,expandgallery_loc class files for adding custom changes if ever needed + 2 other files.)

or if sub-directory is used:
/public_html/sub-directory-name/includes

Also Move the common_dir to your sites home directory:
ie public_html/common_dir  or  /var/www/common_dir

or if sub-directory is used:
/public_html/sub-directory-name/common_dir
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For running multiple sites rename main_class_files folder to includes and place in server home directory above the public dir. ie /home/youracc/public_html
Also place the common_dir in this same server home folder. 

So you end up with something like this:
/home/youracc/includes  or    /var/includes  (containing the main class files)
/home/youracc/common_dir    or  /var/common_dir/

For All installations:

Move the install_file_gen.php file to your site home directory:
ie. /home/youracc/public_html/install_file_gen.php  or /var/www/install_file_gen.ph
if you are using a subdirectory/subdomain then it becomes:   
/home/youracc/public_html/mysubdomain/install_file_gen.php 

Install yourDatabase.sql database starter to mysql with appropriate name.

Inside of the public_html/includes folder is the Cfg.class.php which you need to configure with your database name,  database password, and database host ie 'localhost', and specify an editpages directory name that is not easy to guess as an extra layer of security to prevent unwanted logins. Specify email address for success/error messages and any other configuration you may wish to change the default.

If your using subdomains or subdirectories  
 be sure to specify the subdomain name in Cfg.class.php ie.:
 Owner_dir='sub-domain-name';

Backups of the full database are made everytime the editsite is submitted. To view and restore backups a second database is used with identical fields to the main database. To site this up you give it an appropriate name in the Cfg.class.php const Db_view field. Any backup file will then populate this db to be viewed. This requires an initial install of this second database for subsequent automatic backup. You can use one backup database for multiple sites on same database or make independent backup databases depending on your needs. Copy yourdatabase with or without data using this new database name and it gets overridden for viewing chosen backup files during the backup process. 

Lastly navigate to your site url adding the filename install_file_gen.php to the url which should generate the necessary files.
Then you'll be prompted to set up login credentials and click the link to go to your editor and begin to add your content!!

Delete the install_file_gen.php  file when installation completed.
