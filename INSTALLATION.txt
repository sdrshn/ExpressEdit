Installation Guide

tar -xvf expressEditInstall.tar.gz   decompress files/folders

Relocate files/folders within expressEditInstall directory as follows:

If your running a single site using this system directly in the public html file: 
ie   /home/youracc/public_html   or /var/www/
merge/rename main_class_files to includes folder
Relocation Sample:
/home/youracc/public_html/includes  or  /var/www/includes (containing merged main class files and the Cfg.class.php file)
/home/youracc/public_html/install_file_gen.php  or /var/www/install_file_gen.php
/home/youracc/public_html/common_dir    or  /var/www/common_dir
 
if you are using a subdirectory/subdomain then it becomes /home/youracc/public_html/mysubdomain/includes 
/home/youracc/public_html/mysubdomain/install_file_gen.php  
/home/youracc/public_html/mysubdomain/common_dir
when configuring the Cfg.class.php file (see below) be sure to specify the ie. Owner_dir=”mysubdomain”;

For running multiple sites rename main_class_files folder to includes and place in server home directory above the public dir.  As this folder contains included files add this  directory address to your php.ini include_path directive: for example if it is initially
change include_path=".:/usr/lib/php:/usr/local/lib/php" then change to include_path=".:/home/youracc:/usr/lib/php:/usr/local/lib/php"  and the __autoload function in Sys.php will locate the “includes” directory
Also place the common_dir in this same home folder. 
The original includes dir and the install_file_gen.php file goes into your public_html (or subdomain folder).

So you end up with something like this:
/home/youracc/includes  or    /var/includes  (containing the main class files)
/home/youracc/common_dir    or  /var/common_dir/
/home/youracc/public_html/includes  or    /var/www/includes (contains the Cfg.class.php file which you configure.)
/home/youracc/public_html/install_file_gen.php  or /var/www/install_file_gen.php
 
and again if your using subdomains or subdirectories add it in as shown above 
and then when configuring the Cfg.class.php file (see below) be sure to specify the ie. Owner_dir=”mysubdomain”;


For All installations:

Install yourDatabase.sql database starter to mysql with appropriate name.
For viewing any database you wish to reinstall:
Make a copy of this database (no data required) and rename to your Cfg.class.php  const View_db configuration setting: ie viewbackupdb..
 
Inside of the public includes folder is the Cfg.class.php which you need to configure with your database name,  database password, and database host, editpages directory and other configurations.  Also for backing up a second database is used with identical fields to the main database and you give it an appropriate name in the const Db_view field. Any backup file will then populate this db to be viewed.

Be sure to place the common_dir folder which holds system files that will be moved to necessary subfolders during installation  into the same parent directory where you placed the includes directory holding the main class files 

Lastly navigate to your site url adding the filename install_file_gen.php to the url which should generate the necessary files, set up login credentials and click the link to go to your editor and begin to add your content!!
