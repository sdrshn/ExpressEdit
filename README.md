This Integrated Theme  creating CMS system is built on PHP, MYSQL, JS with flatfiles generated in editmode to replace  MYSQL queries for normal webpage mode.

Build theme templates, slides shows, galleries, navigation menus all RWD responsive from scratch with built in RWD response and for more complicated multi-column layouts use one of two RWD response systems (a 100 grid unit or alternative RWD system). With this system any layout is possible.

Developers will find advanced styling options for general and RWD styling and the ability to easily customize functions that survive updates! The system is built to maximize customization options providing mobile response tools, detailed styling options, configuration options, and tools to enable exporting and importing of previously configurations.

With cloning, the original content is mirrored exactly on another page and changes on the parent are reflected automatically on all pages whether its a complete theme or any part of one.
And for cloned content which may be a whole page now serving as a mirrored template on another page you can unclone any portion of it whether a column with its associated content or a single content post and substitute in newly created content/columns or clone, move, or copy content types including columns of content from elsewhere.
 
Like this any portion of a page can be used for  building other pages and the site can use any number of different templates as needed. Once made pages (primary columns containing columns of organized posts) are importable to other websites built on the system which in turn can use them in part or as a complete template.  The system also has a mechanism where templates can be easily switched out and page specific data retained.
 
Choose to locally style or configure any cloned posts types as required making page specific changes. Or locally change the actual data of a cloned post and keep the styling and configurations of the parent which is very handy for sites having multiple galleries.
